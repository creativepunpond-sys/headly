## 📉 SaaS Adoption Gap = OPPORTUNITY

### **The Paradox:**

- High digital adoption overall ✅
- **LOW SaaS adoption specifically** ⚠️

**Current SaaS Penetration:**
- Only **~10% of juristic SMEs** (~50,000 firms)
- **Untapped potential: 90%** (~450,000 SMEs!)

**Why the gap?**
1. SaaS perceived as "very new" in Thailand
2. Current solutions too expensive
3. Lack of Thai language support
4. No local payment methods (credit card barriers)

**Your Opportunity:**
- Affordable pricing (฿1,999 vs enterprise $30K+)
- Thai language support ✅
- PromptPay payment (no credit card needed) ✅
- Industry-specific (not generic) ✅

---

## 🏆 Competitive Landscape in Thailand

### **Global Enterprise WFM (NOT Competitors):**

**SAP & Oracle HCM**
- Target: Large enterprises only
- Pricing: Enterprise-level (likely ฿90,000+/month)
- Weaknesses: Too expensive, complex, slow implementation
- **They will NOT compete with you** (different market segment)

---

### **Local HR Software (Limited Competition):**

**1. MiHCM**
- Focus: Full HRIS with workforce planning component
- **NOT specialized** in headcount forecasting
- Opportunity: Partner with them (integration)

- Thai tax compliance
- **NOT a forecasting tool**
- Opportunity: Partner for cross-promotion

**3. peopleHum, Zimyo**

- General HR management
- **NOT WFM-focused**
- Weaknesses: No LINE/Telegram, not Thailand-specific

---

### **THE GAP:**

❌ **NO Thai-specific headcount forecasting calculator exists**
❌ **NO affordable WFM tool for SME BPO/CS teams**
❌ **NO tool designed for crypto/fintech CS operations**
❌ **NO tool supporting LINE + Telegram**

**You have ZERO direct competitors in Thailand!** 🎯
